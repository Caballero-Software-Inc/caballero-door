        <h2>Minors</h2>
        Minors (according to the legislation of their country) are accepted as users of Caballero|Door, but their status is different from that of adult users. Minors can access information about adult users, but no user can access their information, i.e., they will be "invisible" in the Caballero|Door network. In addition, minors are not eligible for online research on their behaviour towards vulnerable communities.

        <h2>Consent</h2>
        By accepting these Terms and Conditions, adult users give their consent to Caballero Software Inc. to: <br>
        
        1. Search online and offline (for example, testimonials) if these users may be hostile against certain communities, e.g., by checking for hate speech in social networks associated with users. <br>

        2. Decide for which communities, if any, these users may be hostile. This decision is an opinion based on evidence. <br>

        3. Share this decision (not the evidence) in the Caballero|Door network so that communities that users may be hostile to can see this information. <br>
    
        4. Share your selfie with other users of Caballero|Door network.<br>


        Users who cannot give this consent for legal reasons specific to their country will not be considered for the Caballero|Door service. It is the user's responsibility to notify Caballero Software Inc. if this consent is not possible.

        <h2>Right to transparency</h2>
        Any user has the right to ask Caballero Software Inc. for the evidence which has motivated a decision concerning whether he/she may be hostile to a certain community. Evidence of the decision concerning another user will not be shared.

        <h2>Right to appeal</h2>
        Users have the right to appeal to the decision of Caballero Software Inc. concerning whether they may be hostile to a certain community. This appeal needs to be supported by new evidence provided by the user, e.g., evidence that some of the information found by the licensed private investigator was not accurate.

        <h2>Right to withddraw</h2>
        At any time, the user has the right to delete his/her account in Caballero|Door (this will not affect other accounts from Caballero Software Inc.). All the information about this user will be automatically deleted from the Caballero|Door network.

        <h2>Anti-discrimination policy</h2>
        The Caballero|Door service is intended for personal and collective protection and only for these purposes. If a user uses this service to prevent another person from functioning in society, that user will be punished by deleting his/her account in Caballero|Door. That user can open a new account 30 days later. <br>

        To report any misuse of the Caballero|Door service, for example, the use of this service for discrimination, anyone is free to contact Caballero Software Inc. and provide evidence of your claims.
