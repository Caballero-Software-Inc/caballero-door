<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p style="white-space: pre-line">
   
    At Caballero Software Inc., we are committed to protecting the privacy of the personal information of our customers and users of our digital properties. We take all reasonable steps to ensure that this information is safe and secure, including rigorous policies and procedures to thoroughly comply with all Canadian privacy laws and regulations.

    <h2>Scope & Application of this Policy</h2>

    <h4>Who does this policy apply to?</h4>

This policy applies to All customers and users of the service Caballero|Door, provided by Caballero Software Inc.


In some instances, our products and services or those offered by a third-party service provider to our customers or users have their specific privacy policies.


<h4>What information does this Privacy Policy apply to?</h4>

This policy applies to all personal information that we collect, use, or disclose about our customers and users of our digital platforms.

This information includes everything that Caballero|Door explicitly asks you, e.g., your email, your picture, your location, whether you are an adult, etc.

<h4>What information does this policy not apply to?</h4>

We may de-identify, aggregate, or anonymize any information to identify trends, manage our business, develop statistical information, understand how we perform, or develop relevant products, services, or offers.

Such information may also be shared with third parties for other analytical purposes but will not personally identify any individual.



<h2>Consent</h2> 
<h4>How does Caballero Software Inc. obtain consent?</h4>

Your consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information may be implied or express, through written, oral, electronic or any other method. Creating an account is implied permission to collect the information that you provide until you delete your account.

<h4>Withdrawing Consent</h4>

The choice to provide Caballero Software Inc. with your consent is always yours. You are free to delete your account, and this will automatically erase all information Caballero Software Inc. collected about you. This does not include the information that a licensed private investigator hired by Caballero Software Inc. may keep about you.  The information kept by a licensed private investigator is not considered as controlled by Caballero Software Inc.


<h2>How & Why We Collect Personal Information</h2>

<h4>How does Caballero Software Inc. collect my personal information?</h4>

We primarily collect information about you from you, provided your consent. We do this when you sign-up for a new account or explicitly agree to share specific information.  <br>

<h4>Why does Caballero Software Inc. collect my personal information?</h4>

We collect personal information to prevent people from impersonating other people's identities and bots using our service. To avoid this possibility to some extent, we require authentication of users' email. Also, we need personal information to identify trends, manage our business, develop statistical information, understand how we perform, or develop relevant products, services, or offers., all that without revealing information about identifiable individuals.


<h4>How does Caballero Software Inc. obtain consent?</h4>

    Users will be explicitly asked to give their consent to store and share the information they have provided to Caballero Software Inc. for the Caballero | Door service and only for this service. <br>

    The user will be explicitly asked to give his consent to Caballero Software Inc. for: <br>

    1. Hiring a licensed private investigator to search about them online and offline. This consent is also given to the private investigator selected by Caballero Software Inc.<br>

    2. To evaluate the licensed private investigator's report and decide for which community the user may be hostile. <br>

    3. To share the conclusion mentioned in point 2 with communities of Caballero|Door. <br>

    <h4>Reference to the law about consent and privacy</h4>

    According to The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, <a href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/art8.html">Section 8 – Search and seizure</a> (iii) Consent: <br>

    "It is possible for what would otherwise be an infringement of section 8 to be constitutional if the person concerned waives their constitutional right to privacy. For such waiver/consent to be valid, it must be fully informed and voluntarily given by the rights holder. To be fully informed, a person must be provided with sufficient information to make the preference meaningful (R. v. Borden, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 145). For the consent to be voluntary, the person must have had a real choice in providing the purported consent (see Godbout v. Longueuil (City), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 844 at paragraph 72; Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 551 at paragraph 98)." <br>

    Adults who cannot consent to Caballero Software Inc., for some legal reason, to search for them online are not accepted for Caballero|Door.

    <h2>Minors</h2>

    Users who are minors (according to their country legislation) will not be investigated, and their information (including pictures) will not be required in the service Caballero|Door. This decision is motivated by the assumption that minors' consent is not valid since they are not mature enough to guarantee that they decide their best interest.
    
    Considering that the service Caballero|Door is intended to protect minors from several communities, we agree to provide minors with information about adult users so that they can detect whether some adults may be hostile to them.  On the other hand, no user will receive information about minor users (they will be invisible to the Caballero|Door network).
</p>

<h2>Disclosure</h2>

<h4>When is my personal information disclosed?</h4>

Unless we have your express consent or pursuant to a legal power, we will only disclose your personal information to organizations outside Caballero Software Inc. without your consent in the following limited circumstances: <br>

1. To a law enforcement agency, whenever we have reasonable grounds to believe that you are involved in unlawful activities. <br>

2. To a public authority or agent of a public authority if it appears that there is imminent danger to life or property, which could be avoided or minimized by disclosure of the information. <br>

3. To a public authority or agent of a public authority, for emergency public alerting purposes, if a public authority has determined that there is an imminent or unfolding danger that threatens the life, health or security of an individual and that the danger could be avoided or minimized by disclosure of the information. <br>

<h2>Storage, Security & Retention</h2>

<h4>Where will my personal information be stored?</h4>

Personal information about our customers or users of our digital properties may be stored or processed in or outside Canada. The data will be protected with appropriate safeguards but may be subject to the jurisdiction's laws where it is held.

<h4>How will Caballero Software Inc. ensure my personal information is kept safe?</h4>

Caballero Software Inc. will try to implement the best security and safeguard processes and procedures at its disposal to ensure that the information we have about our customers and users of our digital properties remains safe from theft, loss or unauthorized access. However, we do not offer any guarantee against cyberattacks.

<h4>How long will Caballero Software Inc. retain my personal information?</h4>

Caballero Software Inc. will only retain your personal information for as long as you have an account. Information that is no longer required by us will be destroyed or de-identified.
